## Virus Outbreak Reason and Story
Dr. Jacob Carlington was born in the frigid region of Glaciallus, the heir of the world's largest pharmaceutical company. Despite his privileged upbringing, he had no interest in taking over the family business and instead pursued a career in psychology. Tragedy struck on the eve of Jacob's graduation when a bomb exploded in his parents' company headquarters, killing them both. The perpetrator was none other than Dr. Henry Williams, their closest friend and Jacob's godfather.

Devastated by the loss of his parents and the betrayal of his godfather, Jacob took up residence in the lab, determined to make a name for himself in the scientific community. As the years passed, Jacob's obsession with science and his growing disillusionment with humanity consumed him. He became convinced that the world was overpopulated and that the majority of people were inherently evil. In his mind, the only solution was to create a virus that would cull the world's population and leave behind only the strongest and most resilient individuals.

With single-minded determination, Jacob worked tirelessly in secret, studying the most deadly viruses and experimenting with genetic engineering. Finally, after years of hard work, he succeeded in creating a virus that was both highly contagious and deadly. He released the virus into the world, hoping that it would spread quickly and efficiently, reducing the population and allowing the planet to heal.

But as the virus began to spread, it mutated rapidly, becoming even more deadly and unpredictable. Governments around the world were powerless to stop its spread, and soon chaos and panic reigned. Jacob watched in horror as the virus he had created began to destroy the world. But even as he saw the devastation wrought by his creation, he could not bring himself to regret what he had done. In his mind, he had only done what was necessary to save the planet and ensure a better future for all those who remained.
